<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This project aims to deepen your understanding and mastery of semantic HTML by emphasizing the importance of selecting and implementing the most suitable HTML elements for each type of content. By carefully considering the role of each tag, you'll enhance the clarity, accessibility, and overall structure of your webpage, ensuring that it is both user-friendly and search-engine optimized.</p>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>
The challenge is centered around writing meaningful, well-structured code through the proper use of HTML5 semantic tags. By adopting a thoughtful approach to each element's purpose—such as using [article, header, nav and footer] in the right context—you'll ensure that your web pages are not only functional but also intuitive and accessible for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
